Visual Studio Express
Sometimes people want to try the product without investing thousands of dollars first, so Microsoft has the Express editions for all of their products. 
This makes it perfect for casual users that want to hack out some code as a hobby or programmers who need a free solution to code in C#. 
Be warned though, if the application developed by someone using the express versions of Visual Studio takes off and 
starts making money it would not be surprising to see big brother step in and start asking questions.

Eclipse
The interface is a lot cleaner and concise than Visual Studio and the languages that are possible to use extend past the .Net Framework. 
Besides being the number on way to develop Android applications via the Android SDK.
It is fully extensible to use languages such as Ruby, C, C++ and many many more.

Notbeans
This program is extensible and free, and it compiles code which is a bonus. 
When installing Netbeans it comes with a Java server called GlassFish that you could deploy on your computer for your testing environment. 
This server is the second biggest server for Java next to WebSphere.

Kate
Kate is exactly how the website describes it, a text editor.
Not to be looked down upon as it does a lot more than a regular text edit can do and that is what makes this an indispensable product.

Gedit
Gedit is the official editor of the gnome desktop and comes installed once the system is set up.
Very useful for the user that is casually editing code and not undertaking major projects. 
This would be a good companion to Netbeans or Eclipse.
